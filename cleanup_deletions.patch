NOTE: I did NOT delete `.venv` or `.venv_dev` to avoid breaking an active development environment. If you want those removed too, tell me and I will do so after confirming your virtualenv is not active.

If you need me to create a git commit or actually generate a unified diff, tell me and I will run git commands to produce a proper patch file.
